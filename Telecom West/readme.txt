The original seems to have been made with microsoft FrontPage (which has been discontinued)
I wrote an import file (includes/ImportIncludes.js) to link all the components that the program copy pasted
I uses an iframe to import the include .htm files
Your have to include the script to resize the iframes to match the original content
Importing with iframes only works if the website is hosted (Localhost fails)

I would recomend deleteing all the excess files/folders that the program made (_vti_cnf, _vti_pvt, _private) if possible
It seems thoose files are for restoring backups.
